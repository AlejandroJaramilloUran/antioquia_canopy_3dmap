# 3D representation of Antioquia canopy height
This code is an exercise I carried out with the intention of observing in 3D the forest canopy height of Antioquia, one of the most diverse and populated regions of Colombia. 


The data were obtain from (Lang et al., 2023): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02206-6

Parts of the code were taken and modified from https://github.com/milos-agathon/3d-forest-height-maps
- fh_antioquia.js: shows the code used in Google Earth Engine to obtain the data. 
- ant_canopy_height.R: shows the code used to manipulate and create 2D and 3D plots.
